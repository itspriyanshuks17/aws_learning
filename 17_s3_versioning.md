# 📦 Amazon S3 Versioning — Detailed Explanation

## 🧠 What is S3 Versioning?

Amazon **S3 Versioning** is a feature that **preserves, retrieves, and restores** every version of every object stored in a bucket.  
When versioning is **enabled**, each time you upload (PUT) or delete an object, **S3 automatically assigns it a new version ID**.

This helps you:
- Protect data from accidental overwrites and deletions.
- Retrieve older versions of files.
- Maintain audit trails of file changes.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Version ID** | A unique identifier assigned to each version of an object. |
| **Latest Version** | The most recently uploaded version of an object. |
| **Previous Versions** | Older versions retained when a file is updated or replaced. |
| **Delete Marker** | A placeholder that appears when an object is deleted (but older versions remain unless permanently deleted). |
| **Suspended State** | Disables new version creation but retains existing ones. |

---

## ⚙️ Versioning States

| State | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Unversioned (Default)** | Versioning is disabled; objects have no version IDs. |
| **Enabled** | Each object gets a unique version ID; all versions are kept. |
| **Suspended** | Stops creating new versions; existing ones remain accessible. |

---

## 🧠 Example: How Versioning Works

Let’s say you have a file named `index.html` in an S3 bucket.

| Action | Description | Version ID |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Upload `index.html` | Original upload | `1111` |
| Upload new `index.html` | Replaced file | `2222` |
| Delete `index.html` | Adds delete marker | `3333` |

➡️ **You can still restore version `1111` or `2222`** if needed — S3 keeps them safely stored.

## 🪟 Steps to Enable S3 Versioning (Console)

### 🪣 Step 1 — Open the S3 Console
- Go to [https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3)

### ⚙️ Step 2 — Choose Your Bucket
- Click on the bucket you want to enable versioning for.

### 🧭 Step 3 — Enable Versioning
1. Go to the **Properties** tab.
2. Scroll to the **Bucket Versioning** section.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Choose **Enable**.
5. Click **Save changes**.

✅ Now your bucket has versioning enabled!

## 💻 Enable Versioning using AWS CLI

```bash
# Enable versioning on a bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-versioned-bucket \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

# Check versioning status
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket my-versioned-bucket

# Suspend versioning (does not delete previous versions)
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-versioned-bucket \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Suspended
````

---

## 📂 Viewing Object Versions (Console)

1. Go to the **Objects** tab of your bucket.
2. Click the **“Show versions”** toggle on the right.
3. You’ll see all versions of each object along with:

   * Version ID
   * Last modified date
   * Size
   * Delete markers

---

## 🔁 Restoring a Previous Version

### Option 1 — Console:

1. Open the bucket → **Show versions**.
2. Select the version you want to restore.
3. Click **Download** or **Copy** → re-upload it as the current version.

### Option 2 — CLI:

```bash
# Copy an old version to restore it as current
aws s3api copy-object \
  --bucket my-versioned-bucket \
  --key index.html \
  --copy-source my-versioned-bucket/index.html?versionId=1111 \
  --metadata-directive REPLACE
```

---

## 🧹 Deleting Objects in a Versioned Bucket

### 1️⃣ Delete Current Version (adds delete marker)

```bash
aws s3 rm s3://my-versioned-bucket/index.html
```

➡️ Adds a *delete marker* — previous versions are **not deleted**.

### 2️⃣ Permanently Delete a Specific Version

```bash
aws s3api delete-object \
  --bucket my-versioned-bucket \
  --key index.html \
  --version-id 1111
```

➡️ Removes that version permanently.

---

## 🔄 Example Workflow

```text
User uploads file → S3 assigns Version ID → User updates file → New version created
↓
User deletes file → Delete marker added
↓
User restores old version → Uses version ID to download or copy old file
```

## 📈 Benefits of Versioning

| Benefit                  | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Protection**      | Recover from accidental overwrite or deletion. |
| **Backup and Restore**   | Acts like built-in file history.               |
| **Audit and Compliance** | Keeps an immutable record of changes.          |
| **Easy Integration**     | Works seamlessly with S3 Lifecycle rules.      |

---

## ⚙️ Integration with Lifecycle Rules

You can **automate cleanup or archival** of older versions.

Example: Move non-current versions to **Glacier** or delete them after 30 days.

### CLI Example:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket my-versioned-bucket \
  --lifecycle-configuration '{
    "Rules": [
      {
        "ID": "MoveOldVersionsToGlacier",
        "Status": "Enabled",
        "Filter": {},
        "NoncurrentVersionTransitions": [
          {
            "NoncurrentDays": 30,
            "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## ⚠️ Considerations

| Aspect            | Detail                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Storage Costs** | Each version is stored separately and billed.                |
| **Data Deletion** | Deleting an object doesn’t remove old versions.              |
| **Performance**   | No major impact, but more versions = larger list operations. |
| **Suspension**    | You can pause versioning, but existing versions remain.      |

---

## 🔐 Security and Access

* IAM users need **`s3:GetObjectVersion`** and **`s3:DeleteObjectVersion`** permissions.
* Versioning works with **MFA Delete** for extra protection.

### Example — Enable MFA Delete:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-versioned-bucket \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled \
  --mfa "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user 123456"
```

## 💡 Best Practices

✅ **Enable Versioning early** — it only applies to future uploads.
✅ Combine with **Lifecycle Rules** to manage costs.
✅ Use **MFA Delete** to prevent malicious deletions.
✅ Enable **S3 Object Lock** for compliance requirements.
✅ Regularly audit and clean up unnecessary versions.
