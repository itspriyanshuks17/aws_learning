# ⚖️ AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)

AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.  
It ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and seamless scaling for your applications.

## ⚙️ Types of ELB

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancer; supports path-based, host-based routing | Web applications, microservices |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancer; handles millions of requests per second with low latency | High-performance apps, TCP/UDP traffic |
| **Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)** | Layer 3 load balancer for deploying, scaling, and running third-party virtual appliances | Firewalls, IDS/IPS, network appliances |
| **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** | Legacy ELB; supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP | Older applications |

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ High Availability (HA)

**Definition:** Ability of an application to remain accessible and operational **even if some components fail**.  

**ELB Role in HA:**  
- Distributes traffic across multiple targets in multiple AZs.  
- If one AZ or EC2 instance becomes unavailable, traffic is automatically routed to healthy instances in other AZs.  

**Example:**  
- App deployed in **2 AZs**, each with **2 EC2 instances**.  
- ELB ensures users are unaffected if **1 instance or 1 AZ fails**.

---

### 2️⃣ Fault Tolerance (FT)

**Definition:** Ability of a system to **continue operating properly in the event of a failure** of some of its components.  

**ELB Role in FT:**  
- Performs **health checks** on targets; only sends requests to healthy targets.  
- Detects failed instances automatically.  
- Works with **Auto Scaling Groups** to replace unhealthy instances automatically.  

---

### 3️⃣ Scalability

**Definition:** Ability of a system to **handle increasing load by adding resources dynamically**.  

**ELB Role in Scalability:**  
- Distributes incoming traffic evenly across all available targets.  
- Works with **Auto Scaling Groups** to scale **out** (add instances) or **in** (remove instances) based on demand.  
- Supports millions of requests per second for high-traffic applications.

## 🔹 Types of Scaling

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out / Scale In)** | Add or remove instances to handle traffic. Also called **elastic scaling**. | Auto Scaling launches 2 additional EC2 instances during peak traffic; ELB includes them automatically. |
| **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up / Scale Down)** | Increase or decrease resources (CPU, RAM) on a single instance. | Upgrading EC2 instance from t3.medium → t3.large for more capacity. ELB continues routing traffic to the single instance. |

**Note:** Horizontal scaling is **preferred for web apps** with ELB because it provides **true fault tolerance and high availability**. Vertical scaling alone does not protect against instance failure.

## ⚙️ ELB Components

1. **Listeners:** Process incoming requests and forward to target groups.  
2. **Target Groups:** Logical group of instances or IPs; include health checks.  
3. **Health Checks:** Ensure only healthy targets receive traffic.  
4. **Cross-Zone Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across all AZs evenly.  
5. **Sticky Sessions:** Routes client requests to the same target using cookies.

## 🔧 Create ELB (Console & CLI)

### Console Steps:
1. Navigate to **EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer**
2. Choose type (ALB/NLB/CLB)
3. Configure name, listeners, AZs, security groups
4. Create or select target group
5. Register targets and create

### CLI Example:

```bash
# Create Target Group
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name WebAppTG \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id vpc-0123456789abcdef

# Create Application Load Balancer
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \
    --name WebAppALB \
    --subnets subnet-1234abcd subnet-5678efgh \
    --security-groups sg-0123456789abcdef \
    --scheme internet-facing \
    --type application

# Create Listener
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/WebAppALB/abcd1234efgh5678 \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:targetgroup/WebAppTG/abcd1234efgh5678
