# üß≠ AWS Route Tables

A **Route Table** in AWS defines how **network traffic is directed** within your **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**.  
It acts like a **map** that tells each subnet **where to send the traffic** based on destination IP addresses.

---

## üìñ Concept Overview

Each **subnet** in a VPC is associated with **exactly one Route Table** that controls the flow of outbound and inbound traffic.

- The **destination** specifies a range of IP addresses (CIDR block).
- The **target** specifies where the traffic should go (e.g., Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Peering Connection, etc.).

---

## üß± Structure of a Route Table

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Destination** | CIDR block representing the IP range for the route. |
| **Target** | The network gateway or resource where traffic is directed. |
| **Status** | Active/inactive (automatically managed by AWS). |
| **Propagated** | Whether the route is automatically added by a VPN or Direct Connect. |

---

## üß© Example of a Route Table

| Destination | Target | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local | Enables internal communication within VPC. |
| `0.0.0.0/0` | igw-123abc | Routes all Internet-bound traffic via Internet Gateway. |
| `10.1.0.0/16` | pcx-789xyz | Sends traffic to a peered VPC. |
| `0.0.0.0/0` | nat-567def | Private subnet‚Äôs Internet access through NAT Gateway. |

---

## üßÆ Types of Route Tables

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Main Route Table**
- Automatically created with the VPC.
- All subnets are associated with it by default.
- Typically used for **private routing** (no Internet access).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Custom Route Table**
- User-created for **public or special-purpose subnets**.
- Allows routing to external networks like Internet Gateway or VPN.

| Comparison | Main Route Table | Custom Route Table |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Created By** | AWS (by default) | User |
| **Associated Subnets** | All subnets by default | Manually associated |
| **Use Case** | Internal traffic | Internet-facing subnets |

---

## üåê Public vs Private Route Tables

| Type | Route Example | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Public Route Table** | `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí Internet Gateway` | Used by public subnets for Internet access. |
| **Private Route Table** | `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway` | Used by private subnets to access Internet **without** being exposed. |

---

## üß© Routing Targets in AWS

| Target Type | Example | Description |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **local** | 10.0.0.0/16 | Enables communication within the same VPC. |
| **igw-xxxx** | Internet Gateway | Internet access for public subnets. |
| **nat-xxxx** | NAT Gateway | Outbound Internet access for private subnets. |
| **pcx-xxxx** | VPC Peering Connection | Connects VPCs for private communication. |
| **vgw-xxxx** | Virtual Private Gateway | VPN connection to on-prem data center. |
| **tgw-xxxx** | Transit Gateway | Connects multiple VPCs and networks. |
| **vpce-xxxx** | VPC Endpoint | Private connection to AWS services. |

---

## üß© Route Table Association

- Each **subnet** must be associated with one (and only one) route table.
- Multiple subnets **can share** the same route table.
- If you don‚Äôt explicitly associate a subnet with a route table, it automatically uses the **main route table**.

```bash
# Example: Associate a subnet with a custom route table
aws ec2 associate-route-table \
  --route-table-id rtb-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h \
  --subnet-id subnet-12345678
````

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Example

### Scenario:

You have a **VPC (10.0.0.0/16)** with:

* Public Subnet: `10.0.1.0/24`
* Private Subnet: `10.0.2.0/24`

#### üß© Route Tables:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Public Route Table**

| Destination | Target     | Purpose                    |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 10.0.0.0/16 | local      | Internal VPC communication |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | igw-1a2b3c | Internet access            |

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Private Route Table**

| Destination | Target     | Purpose                         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 10.0.0.0/16 | local      | Internal VPC communication      |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | nat-4d5e6f | Internet access via NAT Gateway |

## üîí Security Integration

Route Tables work **in conjunction with**:

* **Security Groups** (instance-level rules)
* **Network ACLs** (subnet-level rules)

**Example:**
Even if a route allows Internet access (`0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`),
traffic will be **blocked** unless Security Group or NACL rules also allow it.

---

## üßæ Best Practices

‚úÖ Use **separate route tables** for public and private subnets.
‚úÖ Keep routes **minimal** and **specific** to avoid misrouting.
‚úÖ Always include the **local route** (`10.0.0.0/16 ‚Üí local`) ‚Äî AWS adds it automatically.
‚úÖ For production, use **NAT Gateway** over NAT Instance for fault tolerance.
‚úÖ Enable **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor route-level traffic.
‚úÖ Document route table associations for future troubleshooting.

‚úÖ **In Summary:**
Route Tables are the **core of AWS VPC networking**, ensuring that packets reach the right destination efficiently and securely.
They enable **fine-grained traffic control**, separating public-facing resources from private infrastructure while maintaining internal communication.
