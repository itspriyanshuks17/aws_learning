# üß© AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Amazon **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** allows you to **logically isolate a section of the AWS Cloud** where you can launch AWS resources (like EC2, RDS, ELB) in a **secure and controlled network environment**.

It‚Äôs your **own virtual data center** in AWS ‚Äî fully customizable with subnets, IP ranges, route tables, firewalls, and gateways.

## üß† Overview

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Service Type** | Networking & Security |
| **Scope** | Region-specific (each region can have multiple VPCs) |
| **Isolation** | Logical separation using private IP ranges (RFC 1918) |
| **Customization** | Define your own IP ranges, subnets, and routing |
| **Security** | Control inbound/outbound traffic with NACLs & Security Groups |

---

## üì¶ Default vs Custom VPC

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Default VPC** | Automatically created per region; comes with default subnets in each AZ, Internet access, route tables, and security groups. |
| **Custom VPC** | User-created; full control over subnets, routing, gateways, and access rules. Used in production environments. |

## üß© Core Components of a VPC

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CIDR Block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
Defines the **IP address range** of your VPC.  
Example:  
- 10.0.0.0/16 ‚Üí 65,536 IPs  
- Can be divided into smaller **subnets**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Subnets
Subnets divide your VPC into **smaller network segments**.  
- **Public Subnet:** Connected to the Internet via an Internet Gateway (IGW).  
- **Private Subnet:** No direct Internet access; communicates internally or through NAT.  
- Each subnet is tied to **one Availability Zone**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Route Tables
Define how network traffic is directed within the VPC.  
- Each subnet is associated with one route table.  
- Example routes:
  - `10.0.0.0/16 ‚Üí local` (default internal communication)
  - `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí igw-xxxxxxx` (Internet access)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Internet Gateway (IGW)
A horizontally scaled, redundant component that **enables Internet access** for instances in public subnets.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ NAT Gateway / NAT Instance
Used by **private subnets** to access the Internet **without exposing** themselves publicly.

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **NAT Gateway** | Fully managed, scalable, high availability; preferred for production. |
| **NAT Instance** | EC2 instance configured for NAT; user-managed and less scalable. |

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Groups (SG)
Act as **stateful firewalls** that control inbound/outbound traffic **at the instance level**.  
- Default: All outbound allowed; all inbound denied.  
- Example: Allow inbound SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
Act as **stateless firewalls** at the **subnet level**.  
- Evaluated before Security Groups.  
- Each rule must be defined for both inbound and outbound traffic.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Peering
Enables **communication between two VPCs** (same or different regions).  
- No transitive peering (A-B and B-C ‚â† A-C).  
- Useful for multi-account or multi-region architectures.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Endpoints
Allow **private connectivity to AWS services** (like S3, DynamoDB) **without using the public Internet**.

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Interface Endpoint (ENI)** | Connects privately to services using PrivateLink. |
| **Gateway Endpoint** | Used for S3 and DynamoDB. |

### üîü DHCP Option Set, DNS, and Elastic IPs
- **DHCP Option Set:** Assign DNS servers, domain names.  
- **Elastic IPs:** Static public IPs for EC2 instances in public subnets.  
- **DNS Resolution:** Provided by Amazon DNS (Route 53 Resolver).

## üí° Pro Tips

* Always use **multiple AZs** for production-grade fault tolerance.
* Use **NAT Gateway** instead of NAT Instance (for scalability & maintenance-free setup).
* Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for traffic visibility.
* Keep subnets **small and purpose-based** (e.g., Web, App, DB).
* Use **Security Groups for allow rules**, **NACLs for deny rules**.
* Consider **Transit Gateway** for large architectures (multi-VPC setups).
