# üß© AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Amazon **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a **block storage service** designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances.  
It provides **persistent, high-performance, and low-latency storage** that behaves like a physical hard drive attached to your virtual machine.

> üìù NOTE: EBS and EC2 must be in the same Availability Zone (AZ).

---

## üß† Overview

- **Type:** Block-level storage (similar to traditional hard disks).  
- **Scope:** Available **within a single Availability Zone (AZ)**.  
- **Persistence:** Data persists even after EC2 instance termination (if not deleted).  
- **Attachment:** Can be attached/detached to/from EC2 instances in the same AZ.  
- **Backup:** Snapshots stored in **Amazon S3** for durability and disaster recovery.

## üíΩ EBS Volume Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **gp3 / gp2 (General Purpose SSD)** | Balance of price & performance | Boot volumes, dev/test environments |
| **io2 / io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)** | Highest performance & reliability | Databases, critical applications |
| **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)** | High throughput, low cost | Big data, log processing |
| **sc1 (Cold HDD)** | Lowest cost, infrequent access | Archival or rarely accessed data |

üìò **Note:**  
- **gp3** is the recommended general-purpose SSD (customizable performance).  
- **io2** provides 99.999% durability for mission-critical workloads.

## üìÇ Snapshots

- **Definition:** A *point-in-time backup* of an EBS volume stored in Amazon S3.  
- **Incremental:** Only changed blocks since the last snapshot are saved.  
- **Use Cases:**
  - Backup and recovery.  
  - Create new volumes from snapshots.  
  - Copy snapshots across regions for disaster recovery.  

### üß∞ Commands

```bash
aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-0123456789abcdef0 --description "Backup"
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self
aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-0123456789abcdef0

## üîÑ Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)

Amazon **Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)** automates the **creation, retention, and deletion** of EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs.
It helps reduce manual effort and ensures consistent, policy-based data protection.

### üß† Key Concepts

| Feature                  | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Automation**           | Automatically create and delete EBS snapshots or AMIs based on policies. |
| **Retention Management** | Define how many snapshots to retain before older ones are deleted.       |
| **Policy Types**         | Supports **EBS snapshot policies** and **AMI lifecycle policies**.       |
| **Tags**                 | Works by targeting volumes using **tags**.                               |
| **Scheduling**           | Create snapshots daily, weekly, hourly, etc.                             |
| **Integration**          | Works with CloudWatch Events for monitoring.                             |

### üß© How It Works

1. **Tag your EBS volumes** (e.g., `Backup=true`).
2. **Create a lifecycle policy** that defines:

   * Which volumes to target.
   * When to take snapshots.
   * How long to keep them.
3. DLM automatically **creates and deletes snapshots** based on your schedule.

### üß∞ Example Command

```bash
aws dlm create-lifecycle-policy \
  --execution-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole \
  --description "Daily snapshot backup policy" \
  --state ENABLED \
  --policy-details '{
      "ResourceTypes":["VOLUME"],
      "TargetTags":[{"Key":"Backup","Value":"true"}],
      "Schedules":[{
          "Name":"DailyBackup",
          "CopyTagsFromSource":"VOLUME",
          "TagsToAdd":[{"Key":"CreatedBy","Value":"DLM"}],
          "CreateRule":{"Interval":24,"IntervalUnit":"HOURS","Times":["00:00"]},
          "RetainRule":{"Count":7}
      }]
  }'
```

‚úÖ **Result:**
Creates **daily snapshots** of all volumes tagged `Backup=true` and **retains only the latest 7** snapshots automatically.

## üóëÔ∏è Amazon EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin

Amazon **EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin** allows you to **recover deleted EBS snapshots** for a user-defined **retention period**.
This prevents accidental data loss due to unintended deletions.

### üß† Overview

| Feature              | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Retain and restore accidentally deleted snapshots.          |
| **Retention Period** | Between **1 day and 1 year** (customizable).                |
| **Scope**            | Region-specific.                                            |
| **Recovery**         | Snapshots can be restored anytime before retention expires. |
| **Integration**      | Works seamlessly with DLM and manual snapshots.             |

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. You **create a retention rule** in the Recycle Bin.
2. When a snapshot is deleted, it moves to the **Recycle Bin** instead of permanent deletion.
3. You can **restore** it anytime within the retention period.
4. After expiry, AWS **permanently deletes** it from your account.

### üß∞ Example Commands

```bash
# Create a retention rule
aws rbin create-rule \
  --retention-period '{"RetentionPeriodValue":7,"RetentionPeriodUnit":"DAYS"}' \
  --resource-type EBS_SNAPSHOT \
  --description "Retain deleted EBS snapshots for 7 days"

# List Recycle Bin rules
aws rbin list-rules

# Restore a snapshot
aws rbin restore-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-0abcd1234ef567890
```

‚úÖ **Best Practice:**
Use Recycle Bin with DLM ‚Äî DLM handles **scheduled backups**, and Recycle Bin protects **against accidental deletions**.

---

## üîê Security

* **Encryption at Rest:** Uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
* **Encryption in Transit:** Data encrypted between EC2 and EBS.
* **Snapshot Encryption:** Snapshots inherit encryption from the source volume.
* **Access Control:** Managed via IAM policies and roles.
